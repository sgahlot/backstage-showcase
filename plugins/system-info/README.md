# system-info

Welcome to the system-info plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

This plugin calls an API in the **sys-info-backend** plugin to retrieve the System Information data and displays it in
the UI. To access this plugin, run it using `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigate
to [/system-info](http://localhost:3000/system-info).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
